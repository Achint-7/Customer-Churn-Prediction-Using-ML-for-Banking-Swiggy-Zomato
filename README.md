# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to address the critical business problem of customer churn in the banking sector. We have developed a predictive model to identify potential churners and mitigate customer attrition. While this model is initially designed for a bank, it can be adapted to other sectors such as food delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato.

## Problem Statement

Customer churn, defined as customers closing their accounts or migrating to competitor banks, has been a significant issue affecting revenues. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify potential churners and estimate the timeframe within which customers might churn.

## Business Goals

The primary goal is to halt the decline in revenues and retain active bank customers. The model's output can guide various business interventions, including customer-centric bank offers, addressing customer grievances, and applying appropriate interventions for different customer segments.

## Data Sources

The model utilizes data from the following sources:
1. **Transactional Systems:** Utilize data from transactional systems, event-based logs, data warehouses, data lakes, and NoSQL databases.
2. **Churn Modelling Dataset:** The primary dataset used for this project is the Churn Modelling dataset, which can be accessed from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerday.datascience/360/Churn_Modelling.csv).

## Data Quality Assurance

The project addresses issues like de-duplication of events, handling complete or partial data absence, and ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) data.

## Metrics Tracking

The project tracks business metrics such as churn rate, average number of products per customer, percentage of dormant customers, etc., and data-related metrics like F1-score, recall, precision.

## Model Output Format

The model performs periodic runs (monthly/quarterly) and shares the list of potentially churned customers, along with their propensity scores.

## Action Based on Model Output

Based on the model's output, various business interventions are implemented, including customer-centric bank offers, addressing customer grievances, and applying appropriate interventions for different customer segments.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes a README file, documentation folder with detailed files for code, EDA, and model development, a data folder with sample datasets, and a results folder with relevant result files.

## Adaptability

**While the model is initially designed for a bank, it can be adapted to other sectors such as food delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato. By identifying potential churners, these companies can take proactive measures such as sending personalized emails/SMS or offering discount codes or vouchers to retain their customers.**
